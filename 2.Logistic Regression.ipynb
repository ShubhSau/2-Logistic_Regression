    "## Grid Search CV:\n",
    "\n",
    "GridSearchCV is the process of performing hyperparameter tuning in order to determine the optimal values for a given model. As mentioned above, the performance of a model significantly depends on the value of hyperparameters. Note that there is no way to know in advance the best values for hyperparameters so ideally, we need to try all possible values to know the optimal values.\n",
    "\n",
    "GridSearchCV is a function that comes in Scikit-learn’s(or SK-learn) model_selection package.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose of Grid Search CV:\n",
    "\n",
    "GridSearchCV is a technique for finding the optimal parameter values from a given set of parameters in a grid. It’s essentially a cross-validation technique. The model as well as the parameters must be entered. After extracting the best parameter values, predictions are made.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How does GridSearchCV work?\n",
    "\n",
    "we pass predefined values for hyperparameters to the GridSearchCV function. We do this by defining a dictionary in which we mention a particular hyperparameter along with the values it can take. Here is an example of it\n",
    "\n",
    "        param_grid = {\n",
    "    'C': [0.1, 1, 10],              # Regularization parameter\n",
    "    'kernel': ['linear', 'rbf'],    # Kernel type for SVM\n",
    "    'gamma': [0.01, 0.1, 1]         # Kernel coefficient for 'rbf'\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "Here C, gamma and kernels are some of the hyperparameters of an SVM model. Note that the rest of the hyperparameters will be set to their default values\n",
    "\n",
    "GridSearchCV tries all the combinations of the values passed in the dictionary and evaluates the model for each combination using the Cross-Validation method. Hence after using this function we get accuracy/loss for every combination of hyperparameters and we can choose the one with the best performance."

    "\n",
    "Random search tries random combinations of a range of values (we have to define the number iterations). It is good at testing a wide range of values and normally it reaches a very good combination very fast, but the problem that it doesn’t guarantee to give the best parameter combination.\n",

    "On the other hand, Grid search will give the best combination but it can take a lot of time.\n",

    "The choice between Grid Search CV and Randomized Search CV depends on the specific problem, the size of the hyperparameter space, and the available computational resources. Grid Search is a safe and exhaustive option when resources allow, while Randomized Search is a more efficient choice when you need to balance exploration with computational limitations and still want to find good hyperparameters."

    "\n",
    "Data Leakage is the scenario where the Machine Learning Model is already aware of some part of test data after training.This causes the problem of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Machine learning, Data Leakage refers to a mistake that is made by the creator of a machine learning model in which they accidentally share the information between the test and training data sets. Typically, when splitting a data set into testing and training sets, the goal is to ensure that no data is shared between these two sets. Ideally, there is no intersection between these two sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It a problem in machine learning because due to the Data leakage, we got unrealistically high levels of performance of our model on the test set, because that model is being run on data that it had already seen in some capacity in the training set. The model effectively memorizes the training set data and is easily able to correctly output the labels or values for those examples of the test dataset. Clearly, this is not ideal, as it misleads the person who evaluates the model. When such a model is then used on truly unseen data that is coming mostly on the production side, then the performance of that model will be much lower than expected after deployment.\n",

    "    - Features: The data used by the model to predict the target variable.\n",

    "The most obvious and easy-to-understand cause of data leakage is to include the target variable as a feature. What happens is that after including the target variable as a feature, our purpose of prediction got destroyed. This is likely to be done by mistake but while modelling any ML model, you have to make sure that the target variable is differentiated from the set of features."

    "When working with neural networks, generally, the input data is normalized before introducing into the model. In general, data normalization is done by dividing the data by its mean value, and then it is applied to entire data sets. This results in the overlapping of training data sets with test data sets, which causes data leakage issues in the model.\n",
